Break from this
Three days since I've gone
Fallen out of place
Lay down by the lake house I grew on
Time takes on her age
Step back, rebuild
All the damage has been done
I could find my strength
Let them refill all their thoughts of heavy lungs

And though it seems I've lost my time
Drifting through the pines
Finding my way home

Take from this
Three years since I've flown
Calling out my fate
Lay down by the lake house I grew up
Running out the same
Take up a hobby, anything to keep yourself warm
I could find my strength
Step back, rebuild all the damage has been done
So it seems I've lost my time

Drifting through the old headed pines
Looking for a place to go
Finding my way home
